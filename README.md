# traffic-light-system
This project implements a traffic light system for a one-way, single lane road. The traffic light system is simulated using FreeRTOS and an STM32 MCU. Traffic is generated and dynamically adjusted using potentiometer values that are converted from analog to digital, and traffic is moved using a shift register connected to GPIO. As the converted potentiometer values increase, the traffic becomes more congested (cars are more likely to appear on the road). Each car in the traffic is represented by an LED being on at a specific location in the road. The traffic light itself, which is controlled using FreeRTOS software timers, is represented by three vertical LEDs: one green, one yellow, and one red. Furthermore, the duration of the green light is directly proportional to the amount of traffic on the road, and the duration of the red light is inversely proportional.
